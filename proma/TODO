TODO
====

* Support for PostgreSQL (using PEAR::DB)
* Support for quotas
* Sort userlist on different columns
* Let normal users log in to the admin section for maintaining their account
* Show logs (if logging to DB), whole log, per user
* Statistics (if logging to DB), total, over time, per user
* Better design
