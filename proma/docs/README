ProMA (ProFTPd MySQL Admin)
===========================
$Id$

ABOUT
-----
ProMA is a PHP4 based system for administrating a ProFTPd server storing users
in a MySQL database. Features include support for multiple administrators, mail
notifiers when new users register and when accounts are approved, closing of
accounts temporarily, without deleting it or wiping out the password, and a
notepad per user for the admins.

The name ProMA comes from ProFTPd MySQL Admin, but are going to be kept even
though support for PostgreSQL are planned. The first public version was 0.6.0,
released at 2002-02-02. ProMA is written and maintained by Stein Magnus Jodal.
Patches and increased development from ProMA's users are encouraged.
