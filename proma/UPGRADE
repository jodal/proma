UPGRADING
=========

It is always recommended to move the old installation to another
location and install from scratch. That way you get rid of old
deprecated files. Sometimes you can easily use the old configuration.
Please read the instructions below for further information about
configuration changes.

0.6 to 0.7
----------
The new field 'note' is needed in the database.
It can be added with this SQL query:

ALTER TABLE users ADD note text NULL default '' AFTER homedir;

Remember to replace 'users' and 'homedir' with your names if they are
changed from the default.

The new field requires a new line in config.inc.php. Please insert
the following between line 40 and 41.

$users_note            = "note";

There are no other changes to the config file.
